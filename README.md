# WDR-Paper-Computer-Emulator
An emulator for the WDR Paper computer, an educational model created to teach computer architectures and assembly to young people.

This model was initially created by  Wolfgang Back and Ulrich Rohde and it was supposed to work as a computer model executed using just pen and paper.
I created this JavaScript application to support the teaching of computer architectures in High Schools (technical schools) with the purpose of creating 
a more fluid transition to more advanced concepts (introduction -> Paper computer in classroom -> Paper Computer on simulator -> actual assembly).
